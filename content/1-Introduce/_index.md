In the context of modern system operations—where rapid deployment, high resilience, and 24/7 availability are mandatory—manual monitoring or basic alerting is no longer sufficient.

Today's systems require an **intelligent monitoring solution** capable of:
- Early anomaly detection
- Automated response
- Supporting escalation procedures when issues exceed acceptable thresholds

---

## 🕵️‍♂️ What is Continuous Monitoring?

**Continuous Monitoring** is the process of collecting, analyzing, and tracking data from systems, applications, and infrastructure in an **automated, continuous, and real-time** manner to ensure:

- The system is always **available and stable**
- Issues are **detected quickly**
- **Timely information** is provided for automated or manual response

In DevOps, Continuous Monitoring helps the operations team:
- Track **post-deployment application performance**
- Analyze **anomalous behavior or errors**
- Improve **MTTR (Mean Time To Resolution)**

---

## 🚨 What is Alerting?

**Alerting** is the process of automatically generating notifications when unusual events or threshold breaches occur within a system.

An effective alerting system will:
- Monitor **metrics or logs**
- Send alerts via **email, Slack, SMS, SNS, PagerDuty**, or other tools
- Trigger **automated responses** or notify technical teams

Requirements for an effective alerting system:
- **Accurate**: avoid false positives
- **Timely**: respond as soon as an issue is detected
- **Context-rich**: provide sufficient information for investigation
- **Clear escalation** procedures based on severity

## 🎯 Workshop Objectives

This workshop will equip you with the **knowledge and skills** needed to deploy an intelligent monitoring system for DevOps environments:

---

### ✅ Implement Intelligent Monitoring & Alerting System for DevOps Processes

From collecting **metrics, logs, traces** to setting up alerts and automated responses, you’ll build a system that enables the DevOps team to:
- Proactively detect issues
- Reduce MTTR
- Improve system reliability and availability

---

### ✅ Anomaly Detection

Integrate anomaly detection algorithms and tools to:
- Detect unusual behaviors early
- Prevent incidents before they escalate

---

### ✅ Automated Response

Configure **automated responses** that allow the system to:
- **Self-heal** from failures
- **Auto-scale** with increased load
- Minimize manual intervention

---

### ✅ Escalation Procedures

Develop **tiered alerting procedures** to:
- Ensure the right person receives the alert at the right time
- Avoid "alert fatigue"
- Increase incident management effectiveness
