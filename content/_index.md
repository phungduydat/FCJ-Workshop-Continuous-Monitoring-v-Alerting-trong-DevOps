# Working with Amazon Systems Manager - Session Manager

### Overview

Amazon Systems Manager â€“ Session Manager is a fully managed AWS service that enables secure, auditable, and browser-based shell or CLI access to your Amazon EC2 instances and other AWS resources without requiring an inbound port (such as SSH or RDP) to be open.

In this lab, you will:

Learn the core concepts of Session Manager and its role in secure system administration.

Practice connecting to public and private EC2 instances in a VPC without using bastion hosts.

Explore logging and auditing features integrated with AWS CloudTrail and Amazon S3 for compliance.
