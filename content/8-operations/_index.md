# ✅ Operational Procedures & Optimization

## 🔹 1. Creating a Detailed Runbook

A **Runbook** is a step-by-step guide for handling common incident scenarios, including:

| Incident Scenario         | Symptoms                                    | Common Cause                              | Detailed Resolution Steps                                                                   | Responsible Role       |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| CPU at 100%               | CloudWatch alarm “HighCPUUsage”            | Sudden traffic spike                       | 1. Check application logs  <br> 2. Verify running ECS containers <br> 3. Scale ECS service by adding 1 task | DevOps Engineer        |
| Application not responding| Client timeout, “TargetResponseTimeHigh” alarm | ECS service overload or application bug    | 1. Check application logs <br> 2. Manually scale the service if needed <br> 3. Configure auto-scaling alarm | DevOps Engineer        |
